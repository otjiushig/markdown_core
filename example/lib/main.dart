|`***~~italic bold strikethrough 1~~***`|***~~italic bold strikethrough 1~~***|
|`~~***italic bold strikethrough 2***~~`|~~***italic bold strikethrough 2***~~|

## Styling
Style text as _italic_, __bold__, ~~strikethrough~~, or `inline code`.

- Use bulleted lists
- To better clarify
- Your points

## Code blocks
Formatted Dart code looks really pretty too:

```
void main() {
  runApp(MaterialApp(
    home: Scaffold(
      body: Markdown(data: markdownData),
    ),
  ));
}
```

## Markdown widget

This is an example of how to create your own Markdown widget:

    Markdown(data: 'Hello _world_!');

Enjoy!
